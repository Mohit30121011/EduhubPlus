# Ultra-Detailed Mega Prompt for ICMS Activity Diagram

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
Act as a **Business Process Analyst**. I need a detailed **Activity Diagram** (with Swimlanes) for the core workflows of our **Intelligent Campus Management System (ICMS)**.

**CONTEXT:**
The system handles complex, multi-step processes involving different users (Actors) and the System Database. You must represent these flows using **Activity Diagrams**.

**KEY WORKFLOWS TO MODEL:**
*Choose one comprehensive flow or combine them into a High-Level Activity Map.*

### **Workflow 1: Student Admission & Fee Payment**
*   **Swimlanes:** Applicant | System | Admin | Finance
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Applicant fills `Admission Form`.
    2.  System validates `Documents`.
    3.  **Decision Node:** Documents Valid?
        *   *No:* Notify Applicant (End).
        *   *Yes:* Admin approves & generates `Merit List`.
    4.  Applicant pays `Admission Fee`.
    5.  System updates `Fee Status` -> Generates `Roll Number`.
    6.  System sends `Welcome Email`.

### **Workflow 2: Examination & Result Processing**
*   **Swimlanes:** Faculty | System | Student
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Faculty creates `Quiz/Exam`.
    2.  Student attempts `Quiz`.
    3.  **Fork Node:**
        *   *Path A:* System auto-grades (if MCQ).
        *   *Path B:* Faculty manually grades (if Subjective).
    4.  **Join Node:** Grades finalized.
    5.  System calculates `GPA/CGPA`.
    6.  Student views `Result`.

### **Workflow 3: Library Book Issue/Return**
*   **Swimlanes:** Student | Librarian | System Database
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Student requests `Book`.
    2.  Librarian scans `RFID Tag`.
    3.  **Decision Node:** Student has pending fines?
        *   *Yes:* Collect Fine -> Update Record.
        *   *No:* Proceed.
    4.  System checks `Book Availability`.
    5.  Librarian issues Book -> System updates `Inventory` (Decrease count).

### **Workflow 4: Usage of LMS (Learning Management)**
*   **Swimlanes:** Faculty | System | Student
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Faculty uploads `LMS Material` (PDF/Video).
    2.  System notifies `Student Class Group`.
    3.  Student logs in -> Accesses `Course Material`.
    4.  Student downloads `Notes`.

**OUTPUT:**
1.  **Mermaid.js Code:** Generate the diagram using `graph TD` (flowchart) or specific UML Activity syntax if supported.
2.  **Swimlanes/Partitions:** Use `subgraph` in Mermaid to visually separate "Student", "System", "Admin", etc.
3.  **Notation:** Use standard shapes:
    *   `([Start])` / `([End])` - Stadium shape.
    *   `{Decision?}` - Diamond shape.
    *   `[Action/Activity]` - Rectangle.
    *   `-->|Yes|` - Labeled Arrows.

**Focus on the logic and flow of data between the user and the backend system.**
